To pull changes from the main branch into your current rakib branch, you need to merge the main branch into rakib. Here are the steps:



1) Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

    >> git fetch origin



2) Merge the main branch into your current rakib branch:

    >> git merge origin/main




3) Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise: (# Resolve any conflicts if necessary, then:)

NOTE: If there are conflicts, Git will pause and prompt you to resolve them manually. Open the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts, and mark them as resolved:

    >> git add <resolved-file>

    After resolving conflicts, complete the merge:

    >> git commit



4) Push the merged changes to the remote rakib branch:

    >> git push origin rakib
